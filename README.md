# convert-lists
HTML/CSS/PHP/JavaScript/MySQL

I was the project leader for a group of three. Our customer had paper lists that needed to be converted into an online format. We developed a system that allows them to digitally manage the lists. This system enables them to transition from physical to electronic list management.
The database is not included.

These examples are intended to showcase my experience with the basics of web development.
This was my first real software development project.
